# rpi-motorcycle

A project to address the full rewiring of a 1972 Honda CL350. In the process of reparing my recently purchased motorcycle it became clear a new wiring harness was in order. I figured it would be a fun time to implement updated LED systems alongside challenging myself with a project such as this one!

## Notes

Why a raspberry pi? I am most familiar with creating visualizations through python, and as I hope to create my own digital gauge cluster, this seemed like the right pick for me. I also had many old model A's and B's to put to use from previous projects and wanted to put them to use. However, I hope to use a zero 2 for the smaller footprint. Additionally the raspberry pi felt like a flexible platform to work with. Lots of potential for growth or experimentation going forward. Data Logging? Dash Camera? Better Integrated security? RGB????

Currently, the raspberry-pi system and controlled features will be isolated from anything that is responsible for the running of the bike. With my hobbyist mechanic skills at the level they are, adding another layer of convolution would be asking for trouble. I also dont want any program issues to prevent me from making it home, should something go wrong.
